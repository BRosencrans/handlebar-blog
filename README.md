# Handlebar blog demo

## Description

When working this will be an up and running demo blog deployed to heroku, it uses a mysql database, express and sequelize to interact with the database and eventually display an actual webpage using handlebars.

## Instructions

Currently this is a work in progress and only the back end of the application works, to use it you'll need to clone the repo and then connect to mysql and run the schema.sql to create the database, after that close out of mysql and open the integrated terminal again and run npm install to get the required Node modules, then npm run seed to seed the database, after that make sure you have nodemon to connect to the server you can install it by npm install -g nodemon(which installs it globally),  now run nodemon ( just type nodemon into the integrated terminal) Finally you can use the routes created to updated the database using insomnia. In the future there will be a fully deployed webpage to go along with the backend.
